# Fixes for "Couldn't Connect To Servers, Try Using A VPN" & "Encountered An Error Re-Trying"

## Why does Krnl tell me to use a VPN? / "Encountered an error retrying in.."

This occurs when your ISP is blocking the website Krnl uses to host its files (k-storage.com), due to it being marked as "malicious". This is a false positive. (Falsely reported as malicious)

"Encountered an error retrying in.." can happen for several reasons, such as your ISP blocking Krnl websites, or if you didn't install all the [requirements](https://github.com/Krnl-staff/Faq/blob/main/DownloadHelp.md#please-follow-all-the-steps-if-you-want-krnl-to-work-properly) needed to use Krnl.

## Fix : Using ZIP

(IMPORTANT) READ: **Before doing any of the steps please make sure you have the [Requirements](https://github.com/Krnl-staff/Faq/blob/main/DownloadHelp.md#please-follow-all-the-steps-if-you-want-krnl-to-work-properly) & [Anti-Virus Whitelist](https://github.com/Krnl-staff/Faq/blob/main/DownloadHelp.md#anti-virus-whitelist)**

1.) Join the Krnl [Discord](https://krnl.place/invite.html)

- Direct download to the "Latest version" / Beta zip : Run the command "?tag betazip"
([7-zip download - required to extract "betazip"](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2201-x64.exe))

- Direct download to the "Legacy version" / zip : Run the command "?tag zip"

3.) Make sure all the [anti-viruses which you installed are off](https://github.com/Krnl-staff/Faq/blob/main/DownloadHelp.md#anti-virus-whitelist) and extract the zip you just downloaded. Then look for the executable file in the zip folder ("KrnlUI.exe" in betazip/ "krnlss.exe" in zip) and open it. You can now use Krnl.
