# Fixes for "Send Error.Txt to Discord" 

## Option 1 | Re-installing / Directory Check.
1.) Make sure that **ALL** of the files are in the correct directory (Krnl folder). To make sure of this, use the "Install Missing Files" feature, or re-run the bootstrapper after turning off your anti-virus.

## Option 2 | Run Krnl with Maximum Privileges on Your Device.

- Right click on the file, and select "Run As Administrator".
