This issue may arise if your account has been randomly chosen as a part of the Windows client test program.
There are two ways to prevent this from happening.

## Short term solution
This will only work per session (from the moment you join a Roblox game, until you close it).
1. Download the web version of the Roblox client - https://www.roblox.com/download

## Long term solution
This will work until you have been again chosen as a part of the Windows client test program.
1. Create / log into a new account. Join a game and leave it to test if that account has been chosen (It should open the web version if you're good to go)
2. Reinstall the Roblox web client - https://www.roblox.com/download
- Alternatively if none of this works, you can try to run Krnl as administrator.
