# Fix for "Chrome Blocking KRNL From Downloading"
## Option 1: Unblocking.
1.) The first what we will do is unblocking KRNL on chrome. To do that, follow the steps below:
* Hit CTRL+J on your keyboard (Make sure Chrome is active).
* [In "Downloads" Section, find "krnl_bootstrapper.exe" and click on "Keep dangerous file" (Image).](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053725471688368179/1099059062638907442/chrome_AXC9oCLoXg.png)
* [If there's another pop-up in Chrome saying "Keep dangerous file?" Click "Keep anyway" (Image).](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053725471688368179/1099059082423455754/chrome_mzVdVrzHyc.png)
