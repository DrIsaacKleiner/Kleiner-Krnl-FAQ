# Fix for "Chrome Blocking KRNL Beta From Downloading"
## Option 1: Unblocking.
1.) The first what we will do is unblocking KRNL Beta on Chrome. To do that, follow the steps below:
* Hit CTRL+J on your keyboard (Make sure Chrome is active).
* [In "Downloads" Section, find "krnl_beta.exe" and click on "Keep dangerous file" (Image).](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053725471688368179/1099067242794201178/chrome_RO4PdEdTAj.png)
* [If there's another pop-up in Chrome saying "Keep dangerous file?" Click "Keep anyway" (Image).](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053725471688368179/1099067255863656478/chrome_9HdeLDxeCr.png)
