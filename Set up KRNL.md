# Anti-virus Whitelist / Disabling Anti-virus
**Krnl, like ANY other roblox exploit will be marked as a virus. This is known as a "False postive", where windows thinks the "Krnl.dll" file is a virus due to it being obfuscated, but you can rest assured that Krnl is 100% safe.
You can actually decompile the entire UI using DN spy.**

Lets start by whitelisting Krnl from Window's in-built anti-virus.

1.) Open Settings, and type "Windows security". It should open the windows security panel.

2.) Select the "Virus and Threat Protection" option.

3.) You'll want to navigate to [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1053725471688368179/1099099376497987706/ApplicationFrameHost_4fWLYvRKA4.png). Then, disable the "Real Time Protection" option.


**(NOTE: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TURN OFF YOUR WHOLE ANTI VIRUS BUT INSTEAD JUST WHITELIST/EXCLUDE KRNL, READ BELOW)**

- To whitelist Krnl begin from step 3 shown above, and instead of disabling "Real Time Protection", navigate to the bottom and look for "Add or Remove Exclusions" option.

- Select "Add an Exclusion" and select "Folder". From there, you can navigate to the Krnl folder and set it as a exclusion.


# Other Anti-viruses

You may have a Third-Party anti-virus installed, alongside Window's in-built anti-virus. Depending on which one you have, setting a exclusion or disabling it may be tricky. The steps below will demonstrate how to uninstall any third-party antivirus you may have on your device.

1.) Press the windows key + R and type "appwiz.cpl"

2.) Look for any third-party antivirus (Common keywords may be "protection", "real-time", "antivirus", "security", etc.)

3.) Select "uninstall".
