# Stuck at "Checking Key"

**This issue is actually the same as the  "stuck at waiting for Roblox" issue, but camouflaged. It is caused by one of the hooks that are made by Krnl at injection, being overwritten by another application, eg. Msi Afterburner.**

- To fix this, close all the apps running in the background ([Check the system app tray!](https://i.imgur.com/DRuifz9.png)) and reopen Roblox. Then try injecting Krnl again.
