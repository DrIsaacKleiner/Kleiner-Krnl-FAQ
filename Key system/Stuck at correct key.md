# Stuck at "Correct Key!"

- This issue is relatively simple to solve. While you're stuck at "correct key", open task manager, find Roblox and kill the instance.
If you are using the [latest Krnl UI](https://k-storage.com/krnl_beta.exe), you can click the dropdown button on the left hand side and press ["Close Roblox"](https://i.imgur.com/MgunbPo.png).

  * After this, rejoin your game and get a [new key!](https://cdn.krnl.place/getkey.php)
